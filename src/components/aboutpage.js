            <h1>About us </h1>
            <p>There are numerous websites with information about energy so it would be hard for you to look up the information you need. Our websites give you an insight into the energy use profile in your regions by providing pictorial presentations from a range of Australian Government sources. The data demonstrated on this website solely covers the Australian regions and it concentrates on consumption, production as well as the conversion of energy. Generally, Australia can completely rely on self-generated energy. The total output of all-electric energy-producing facilities is 243 billion kWh, accounting for 106% of total requirements. The remainder of self-produced energy is either exported or goes unused. Along with pure consumption, production, imports, and exports all play significant roles. Natural gas and crude oil are also used as energy sources.</p>

            <h1> Our missions</h1>
            <p>As Swinburne is committed to helping individuals and society work towards a more sustainable future, we are here to help. Rather than considering it as a project, we see itself as a research and information design pathway through which we learn ourselves the university's ambition and approach.
We consolidate statistical data and resources from multiple authorized sources that are referenced in the data set or process book and make it available in easy approach forms such as graphs and charts. It provides you with several options to choose from, to deeply understand the data or use the visualization in the way you like. The reference tools are also available to help you embed the visualization into your own websites or cite it in your documents.
We welcome your feedback about this website and encourage you to contact us if there are any questions or suggestions.</p>
